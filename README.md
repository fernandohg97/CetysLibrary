# CetysLibrary

The project consists of a system of access control to cubicles and rooms within my school library.

It's a web application where the user can reserve a cubicle or a room at a specific date and time. It also generates reports to visualize the registers.

This application is built with Nodejs, Express, MongoDB and Angular.
